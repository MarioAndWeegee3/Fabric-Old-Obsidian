# Fabric Old Obsidian

Built For Fabric

Adds the removed glitch that lets you turn Redstone Wire into Obsidian.

To use, install on the server. Client installation is not mandatory. Fabric API is not required.

The ~~glitch~~ feature itself:

* Place a water source or waterlogged block
* Place Redstone Wire next to the water.
* Pour Lava on top of the Redstone.
